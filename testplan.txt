Testcases:

For all of our testcases we made the constraints as best as possible to avoid any and all errors that may occur
during workloads like C, D, E, and F.

Testcase E:
----------

This test cases was to test malloc and see how well it would handle mallocing large chuncks of memory and 
mallocing until capactiy. It malloced 10 chunks of 300(plus metadata) bytes into the heap, and then freed
everything at the end. We chose 10 because using 11 chuncks would cause the program to error on rare 
occasions stating the user tried to allocate too much space. With 12 chunks it would cause the same error
every time. The idea was to test if our malloc could handle allocating a larger amount of bytes than the
previous workloads and if it could handleallocating all of its space and then freeing it.


Testcase F:
----------

This test cases was similar to testcase E, but this time after allocatig the max space we freed blocks in between
the active blocks. We malloced until capacity, and then freed every other block, then re malloced those free chunks,
then freed everything. This workload was to test if our free could free blocks in between active blocks and to see
if our malloc could malloc chunks in between already active chunks. We chose a smaller chunk to malloc (200 bytes)
when re mallocing so this creates more chunks in the heap, between freed and malloced chunks, than when we had
freed every other block.
